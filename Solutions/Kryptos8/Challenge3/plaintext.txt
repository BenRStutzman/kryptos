Thank you for all of your hard work to date. Our operatives are in place and
we expect dozens of local citizens to be on hand for the marches. We expect full
media coverage and our social media trolls are on hand to spread the news the
moment the first protesters yell. Finally, the big event is on on hand. I can now
reveal the final location and time so we can ll mobilize and accomplish our
missions. Ground zero will be Grant Park Chicago, next Friday at ten AM. -G
