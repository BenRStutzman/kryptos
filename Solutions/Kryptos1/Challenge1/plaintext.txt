I AM WRITING TO INFORM YOU OF THE NEED TO CHANGE OUR CURRENT CIPHER SYSTEM. IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT SOME LEARNED INDIVIDUALS CAN BREAK SUCH SECRECY SCHEMES SIMPLY BY TALLYING CERTAIN OCCURRENCES OF LETTERS, WHETHER THEY ARE ENCIPHERED OR NOT. HOWEVER, I HAVE SOME IDEAS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION WITHOUT ANYONE BEING AWARE OF ITS MEANING OR IMPORTANCE. LET US MEET AT THE END OF THE WEEK AT THE FOUNTAIN. I WILL DESCRIBE THE NEWLY DEVELOPED CIPHER WHICH THEY SAY IS COMPLETELY UNREADABLE. UNTIL THEN, DO NOT TRUST THIS CIPHER WITH ANY INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE. THE KING HAS EYES AND EARS EVERYWHERE.
